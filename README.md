Problem (Why it matters)

Modern businesses generate massive amounts of data from multiple sources—sales, marketing, operations, finance—but extracting actionable insights is challenging. Current BI processes often suffer from:

Data fragmentation: Data is scattered across different systems (CRM, ERP, web analytics, spreadsheets).

Manual reporting: Analysts spend hours cleaning, aggregating, and visualizing data instead of focusing on insights.

Slow decision-making: Managers may not have timely, data-driven insights, leading to delayed or suboptimal decisions.

Example scenario: A retail company wants to identify trends in product sales and customer behavior, but their team struggles to consolidate sales data from online and offline channels, delaying marketing and inventory decisions.
